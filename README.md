# ogdigits
OpenGL viewer for working with Kaggle's digit data

uses cmake to create the Makefile
builds ogdigits.app

loads Kaggle's Digits data from ../data/digits/* that you need to download/create

has a bunch of dummy functions where one can put their models and learners - this project was focused
on creating a viewer on Linux using OpenGL.  On can see any of the digits in the test or training data.
It displays some stats using a font engine I was working on at the time.

You can modify and/or use the code from this project to your hears content.
